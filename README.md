# Axonish

Axonish is a nodejs microservice framework implemented in typescript. The goal is to implement developer friendly Cqrs and eventsourcing
framework, with graphql api front-end. The name "axonish" is derived from [axon](https://axoniq.io/) framework. Although, it is not a nodejs
port for [axon](https://axoniq.io/), the initial inspiration came after going through the axon docs.

Axonish itself is an amalgamation of lots of libraries and their dependencies, to name major ones:

- [type-graphql](https://github.com/19majkel94/type-graphql)
- [apollo-server](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server)
- [cote](https://github.com/dashersw/cote)
- [graphql-js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js)
- [graphql-yoga](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga)

Basic idea is to use [decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html) to define all major aspects of your application,
which in many ways is similar to [nestjs](https://nestjs.com/), but one of my major goal is to reduce a lot of configuration boiler-plates.
However, a lot of other boiler-plates may get introduced ðŸ˜ƒ

More than a framework, Axonish will strive to be an **opinionated** programming model, and project architecture. Please note the word **opinionated**,
it means there will be right ways to do things, which you may or maynot agree with.
